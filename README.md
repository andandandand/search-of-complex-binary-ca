# **Search of Complex Binary Cellular Automata Using Behavioral Metrics**#

![self-rep3.PNG](https://bitbucket.org/repo/dodynj/images/4082026190-self-rep3.PNG)

Preprint, *Mathematica* demos of complex CA found, and search algorithm implementation in Java.

##Instructions to run the Discoverer search app##

*Java 6+ required. 

After downloading the discoverer_1_0.zip file, decompress it and run from a command line


```
#!bash

 java -jar discoverer_5_2.jar
```

Hitting the **RUN** button in the UI will start the genetic search of CA whose behavioral measures are close to the Game of the Life in the non-totalistic Moore neighborhood.

The cellular automaton in the population with behavior closer to the GoL will evolve on the right panel. 

*Export to Mathematica* creates a notebook with the found automata in Wolfram code.
