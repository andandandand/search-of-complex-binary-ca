![self-rep3.PNG](https://bitbucket.org/repo/dodynj/images/4082026190-self-rep3.PNG)

Preprint, *Mathematica* demos of complex CA found, and search algorithm implementation in Java.

##Instructions to run the Discoverer search app##

*Java 6+ required. 

After downloading the discoverer_1_0.zip file, decompress it and run from a command line


```
#!bash

 java -jar discoverer_5_2.jar
```

Hitting the RUN button in the UI will start the search of CA whose behavioral metrics are close to the Game of the Life in the non-totalistic Moore neighborhood.
